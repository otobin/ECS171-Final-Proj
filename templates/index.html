                                <p class = "infoText">There have been occasional problems with walking around big cities like San
                Francisco regarding robbery or other crimes in certain neighborhoods or streets,
                especially at night. For instance, if we want to get a slice of pizza at Tenderloin
                our Google Maps might route us through a street with bad crime history or
                homelessness population which is risky, especially if you walk alone at night.
                The app is designed to improve safety of the users by quantifying how safe a
                neighborhood is based and would suggest whether to taken an Uber/Lyft rather
                than walking, or to completely avoid it.

                <strong><h2 style = "text-align: center;">Goal</h2></strong>
                                <p class = "infoText">The goal of our project is to design a model that can quantify the safety of a
                                    route given by the Google Directions API. While giving the safest route is too
                                    complex for an 8 week project, our group hopes to train a model that takes in
                                    the geographic location of a route from Google, and outputs the safety on a
                                    certain numerical scale using an unsupervised learning model like clustering.

                                    last update on March 25, 2021. The dataset contains 2.13M observations with 14
                                    attributes. The main attributes are incident ID, incident category, description
                                    of the incident, day, date, time and geographic data of the incident.
